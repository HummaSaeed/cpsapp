However, drag clicking takes this to a whole new level.

These tapes help create the right resistance between your finger and the mouse button.</li><li><b>Apply tape to your finger:</b> Cut a small piece of tape and place it on the tip of your finger. This will give your finger an extra grip, which is essential for generating clicks while dragging across the button.</li><li><b>Position your finger:</b> Rest your taped finger gently on the mouse button. Make sure it's not pressing down too hard—just enough to maintain contact with the button surface.</li><li><b>Start dragging your finger with light pressure:</b> Gently drag your finger across the mouse button, allowing the tape to generate clicks as it moves.

Drag clicking is all about achieving the highest possible CPS, often exceeding 30 clicks per second. It’s perfect for tasks or games that benefit from rapid bursts of clicks, though it can be less accurate and harder to perform consistently.</p><p>On the other hand, butterfly clicking provides a more balanced approach. While it offers a lower CPS, typically around 15 to 20 clicks per second, it gives you much more control over your actions. This makes butterfly clicking ideal for scenarios where accuracy and precision are just as important as speed, like in PvP combat or building tasks in games.</p></div></div></div>"

Accuracy</h5><p>Speed is essential, but accuracy is equally critical in achieving a high APM. Every action should serve a purpose, whether it’s moving a unit, queuing a build command, or selecting abilities. If actions are inaccurate or involve excessive misclicks, they may inflate APM without contributing to success in the game. Efficient players have high APM and accuracy, making every click count.</p><h5>2. Result</h5><p>A high APM is meaningful only if it leads to positive in-game outcomes. Actions that have real impact, such as successful attacks, defense, or resource management, matter more than a flurry of meaningless actions. Focus on the quality of your actions, ensuring that each one helps you achieve your objectives.</p><h5>3. Spamming</h5><p>Spamming refers to performing a lot of unnecessary or repetitive actions simply to inflate your APM. While this might artificially boost the number, it doesn't improve your skill or help you win. In some cases, spamming can hinder gameplay by causing you to lose focus on important decisions or mismanage resources.</p></div></div></div>"
